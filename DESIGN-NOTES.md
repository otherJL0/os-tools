# How AerynOS delivers software to OS installs

## Software package metadata: manifest.*.bin

The `manifest.${ARCH}.bin` files contain all the metadata needed by the AerynOS tooling. For context, the `manifest.${ARCH}.jsonc` files are only there for git diff purposes and human-readable insight. They are completely ignored by the tooling.

## Software distribution via *.stone packages

AerynOS distributes software via its custom `stone` format. This format was explicitly built to enable fast, deduplicated transmission and installation of software artefacts on target OS installs.

    > so when we "cache" / install a package, in reality we're ripping the content payload out, then using the index payload to shard it into the unique assets in the store to build up the content addressable storage
